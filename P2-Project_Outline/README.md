## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A virtual space for creative meditation and curation
We have users that add content into their own personal “playlists” through the use of links (also maybe files?) in order to feel, go through, or connect with certain emotions. 
These “playlists” would contain a variety of items such as music, videos, images, quotes, etc (could be full of all of one form of item or diversified to all types). 
These playlists would be personal and contained within a user profile that requires authentication. Content added by the users would be added to the website library for other users to potentially utilize for their playlists as well. Includes limitations for how many items could be placed within a playlist. Users have the option to create profiles and make them private or public to other users.
